# Benefits of Cloud Computing

### 1. Trade Capital Expense (CapEx) for Operational Expense (OpEx)
No upfront hardware costs — pay only when you use resources.

### 2. Massive Economies of Scale
AWS aggregates usage across millions of customers → lower per-unit cost.

### 3. Stop Guessing Capacity
Scale up or down based on demand.

### 4. Increase Speed & Agility
Provision resources within minutes instead of weeks.

### 5. Global Reach in Minutes
Deploy workloads worldwide using AWS Regions.

### 6. Increased Reliability
Redundancy, fault-tolerance, and automated backups.
